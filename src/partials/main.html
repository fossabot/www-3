        <p>
          Greetings! I'm Ricky, a polyglot software developer currently living in <a title='The Big Smoke 🌋' href='https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Toronto,+ON,+Canada'>Toronto, ON. Canada.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          For the past several years I've been building interactive web applications with <a title='A JavaScript library for building user interfaces' href='https://reactjs.org/'>React</a>, <a title='Predictable state container for JavaScript applications' href='https://redux.js.org/'>Redux</a> and <a title="JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine" href='https://nodejs.org'>Node.js</a> (<a title='A high-level, interpreted programming language' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript'>JavaScript</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also written programs in <a title='An interpreted high-level programming language' href='https://www.python.org/'>Python</a>, <a title='Bash is a Unix shell and command language' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)'>Bash</a>, <a title='A systems programming language that runs blazingly fast' href='https://www.rust-lang.org/'>Rust</a> and <a title='A server-side scripting language' href='http://www.php.net/'>PHP</a>. I tend to work on the <a title='What you see in the browser' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development'>front-end</a>, but I'm no stranger to <a title='Determines the quality of the software product or service' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development'>testing</a> and <a title='A process or procedure that is performed without human assistance' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation'>automation</a>. I've also used <a title='Build native apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS' href='https://electronjs.org/'>Electron</a> to build cross platform desktop applications.
